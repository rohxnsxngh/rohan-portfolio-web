          Machine Learning Applied to Baseball: A Detailed Overview
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          In the MEEN 423 course at Texas A&M, our team took on an exciting
          project that combined our love for baseball with the power of machine
          learning. Our goal was to analyze and predict baseball umpire calls
          using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on how
          umpires decide whether a pitch is a ball or a strike.

        />

        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Project Objective</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Our primary objective was to develop a Python script that leverages a
          RandomForestClassifier to identify patterns in umpire decision-making.
          By doing so, we aimed to understand the factors influencing these
          calls and improve the accuracy and objectivity of baseball
          officiating.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Data Collection and Preprocessing</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          The first step involved collecting and preparing the data. We gathered
          extensive pitch data, including pitch location, type, and outcome. The
          preprocessing phase involved cleaning the data, normalizing it for
          consistent analysis, and segregating it by individual umpires to
          account for their unique decision-making styles.

          class="w-full my-2 rounded-lg border-2 border-primary"
        />

        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Building the RandomForestClassifier</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          We then built a RandomForestClassifier, a robust machine learning
          model, to analyze the data, involving data normalization to ensure all
          data points were on a common scale, a train-test split to divide the
          data into training and testing sets for evaluating the model's
          performance, and model training to identify patterns in the prepared
          data.
        </p>

        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Visualization</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          To make our findings more intuitive, we incorporated visualization
          techniques, including decision boundary visualization to help
          understand how different factors influence the umpire's calls.
          Recognizing areas for improvement in our initial script, we
          implemented several enhancements and optimizations. Cross-validation
          was introduced to ensure the model's robustness and accuracy,
          providing a more reliable performance evaluation. We also developed a
          hyperparameter tuning script to optimize the model for each umpire,
          resulting in more precise configurations tailored to individual
          decision-making patterns. Additionally, feature importance analysis
          was conducted to identify the most influential features, such as pitch
          location and type, in the decision-making process, thereby offering
          deeper insights into the factors that impact umpire calls.

        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Outcomes and Insights</h1>
        <p class="mb-10">
          By integrating machine learning, our project aimed to significantly
          enhance the accuracy and objectivity of umpire calls in baseball.
          Leveraging these advanced technologies, the model provided deep
          insights into the decision-making process of umpires, potentially
          leading to fairer and more consistent officiating. This technological
          integration promises to reduce human error and bias, thereby improving
          the overall quality of the sport. This project illustrated the dynamic
          intersection of technology and sports, highlighting how innovations in
          machine learning can revolutionize traditional sports practices. The
          ability to predict umpire calls with high accuracy showcases the
          potential for continuous improvement and innovation in sports
          analytics. This advancement not only benefits the umpires by providing
          them with objective feedback but also enhances the viewing experience
          for fans by ensuring a fairer game. The journey through this project
          was both challenging and rewarding. We successfully developed a
          sophisticated tool that improved our understanding of umpire calls,
          demonstrating the powerful synergy between sports and technology. Our
          work underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches,
          combining technical expertise with a passion for sports to solve
          real-world problems. For those interested in exploring our work
          further, the project is available on GitHub under the title "Machine
          Learning MEEN Project." This repository contains all the code and data
          used, offering a resource for others to build upon and innovate
          further. The project included several visualizations to make our
          findings more intuitive. This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply
          machine learning in a real-world context, blending our technical
          skills with a passion for baseball. It not only contributed to the
          field of sports analytics but also served as a testament to the
          transformative power of technology in enhancing traditional practices.
          As technology continues to evolve, the potential for its application
          in sports and other areas will only grow, paving the way for further
          innovations and improvements.
