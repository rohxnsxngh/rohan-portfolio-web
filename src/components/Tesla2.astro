          My Adventure at Nvidia: A Summer as a CAD Engineering Intern
        </h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          I had the amazing opportunity to intern at Nvidia as a Computer-Aided
          Design (CAD) Engineering Intern. It was a fantastic blend of technical
          challenges and fun experiences that made the entire journey
          unforgettable.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Automating Tasks with C++ Scripts</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          One of the first projects I tackled was developing and implementing
          C++ scripts to automate tasks within our CAD software. Imagine having
          a magical wand that could take care of repetitive and mundane tasks
          for you. That’s what these scripts did! They boosted our efficiency
          and productivity by a solid 15%, freeing up our time for more exciting
          and intricate design work. This was also my first experience using C++
          in the indsutry and it was exhilirating.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Cracking the Code of GD&T</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Next, I dived into the world of Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing
          (GD&T). It might sound like a mouthful, but it’s all about making sure
          every little detail in our CAD models is spot-on. I quickly became the
          go-to person for ensuring our designs were precise and met all the
          necessary standards. It was like solving a puzzle, ensuring everything
          fit together perfectly.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Design for Manufacturability (DFM) Magic</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Incorporating Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles into our
          projects was another fascinating aspect of my role. Think of it as
          designing with a sprinkle of practicality – making sure our creations
          were not only awesome but also easy and cost-effective to manufacture.
          It was a bit like playing a strategic game, balancing creativity with
          real-world constraints.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Crafting Detailed 3D Models</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          One of my favorite tasks was creating detailed 3D models of equipment
          and data center layouts. It was like being an architect in a digital
          world, ensuring every model was precise and aligned with project
          specifications. I took pride in making sure my models were top-notch,
          ready to be brought to life in the real world.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Mastering CAD Software</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Throughout my internship, I became quite the CAD software wizard,
          mastering tools like Creo, Windchill, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360. Each
          software had its quirks and superpowers, and getting the hang of them
          was both challenging and exhilarating. It felt like having a toolbox
          full of gadgets, each perfect for different design adventures.
        </p>
        <h1 class="mb-2 font-bold">Wrapping Up the Adventure</h1>
        <p class="mb-2">
          Looking back, my internship at Nvidia was an incredible journey. From
          automating tasks and perfecting designs to mastering cutting-edge
          software, I learned so much and had a blast doing it. This experience
          not only sharpened my skills but also fueled my passion for
          engineering design. It’s safe to say that this summer adventure has
          left a lasting impression, and I’m excited for what the future holds!
