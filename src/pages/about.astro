        <p>
          I was born in Goa, India, and moved to the U.S. when I was around
          eight years old. Growing up, I was always drawn to two things—<span class="font-medium text-primary">sports
          and building</span>. Tennis and soccer were my first obsessions, and I poured
          countless hours into them, eventually walking onto Texas A&M's
          Division 1 tennis team before COVID changed everything. That shift
          pushed me to channel my competitive drive into something else:
          <span class="underline decoration-primary decoration-2 underline-offset-4">engineering</span>.
          Whether it was coding, designing, or breaking things
          apart just to understand how they worked, I found the same thrill in
          building that I once did in sports <span class="italic text-slate-500/90">(here are some videos of me as a retired athlete somewhere in jamaica).</span>

        That passion led me to <span class="font-medium">Texas A&M</span>, where I earned a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering
        with minors in Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My journey through tech has been diverse and 
        exciting—from developing robotics projects at my University clubs as well as 
        working at industry giants like <span class="text-blue-500 underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4">ASML</span>,
        <span class="text-red-300 underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4">Toyota</span>,
        <span class="text-red-500 underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4">Tesla</span>, and
        <span class="text-lime-500 underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4">Nvidia</span>.
        Now, I'm pursuing my passion at <span class="font-medium">Carnegie Mellon University</span>,
        diving deep into AI, robotics, and control systems—exploring how machines can learn
        and adapt in dynamic environments.

      <p class="mt-6 sm:text-lg text-md text-left">
        Beyond my formal roles, I'm a <span class="font-bold text-primary">startup enthusiast</span> and 
        founder of <span class="text-slate-400 hover:underline decoration-2 underline-offset-4"><a href="https://www.quaternionstudios.com/">Quaternion Studios</a></span>. I'm deeply passionate about
        <span class="italic">building companies in the hardware space</span> that contribute to a truly
        abundant future. My goal is to bridge cutting-edge AI with practical engineering solutions
        that solve real-world problems. When I'm not working on projects, you'll find me playing
        pickup basketball, exploring new breweries, or just creating—whether it's software,
        hardware prototypes, or something completely unexpected.
