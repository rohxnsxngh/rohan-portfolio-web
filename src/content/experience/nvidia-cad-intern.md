## Kicking Off My Engineering Journey: CAD Internship at NVIDIA  

My internship at NVIDIA was my first real-world engineering experience after working as a SolidWorks TA, where I taught CAD fundamentals and design principles. While teaching gave me a strong foundation, stepping into NVIDIA's fast-paced environment took my skills to a whole new level.

## Automating CAD Workflows with C++  

One of my key projects involved developing C++ scripts to automate repetitive tasks in our CAD software. This significantly boosted efficiency, reducing manual work by about 15% and allowing engineers to focus on higher-value design tasks. It was my first time applying C++ in a real-world setting, and seeing my code streamline processes was both exciting and rewarding.  

## Mastering GD&T and Precision Engineering  

I also gained hands-on experience with Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), ensuring that every design met precise manufacturing standards. This was a major shift from my prior academic projects, where tolerances were often an afterthought. At NVIDIA, precision was everything—every component had to be manufacturable at scale, and I became the go-to person for verifying compliance with GD&T standards.  

## Designing with Manufacturability in Mind  

Applying Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles was another major learning experience. I learned to think beyond just creating a perfect CAD model—each design needed to be optimized for cost-effective and scalable production. This aspect of the internship challenged me to balance creativity with real-world constraints, reinforcing the importance of practical engineering design.

## 3D Modeling and Large-Scale Layouts  

A big part of my role involved creating detailed 3D models of equipment and data center layouts. Transitioning from modeling individual parts to designing large-scale systems was eye-opening. It required meticulous attention to detail and a strong understanding of spatial organization to ensure everything fit together seamlessly.  

## Expanding My CAD Toolkit  

During this internship, I worked extensively with multiple CAD tools, including Creo, Windchill, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360. While I was already proficient in SolidWorks from my TA experience, mastering new platforms broadened my skill set and deepened my understanding of industry-standard design workflows.  

## Wrapping Up: A Defining First Internship  

Looking back, my time at NVIDIA was an invaluable first step into the engineering world. It bridged the gap between the theoretical knowledge I had as a TA and the practical skills required in a high-tech industry. This experience not only sharpened my technical abilities but also solidified my passion for engineering design, automation, and problem-solving.  

It was the perfect start to my journey—one that would later lead me to robotics, AI, and deeper explorations into intelligent systems.
