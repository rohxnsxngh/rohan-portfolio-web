## Kicking Off My Engineering Journey: CAD Internship at NVIDIA

My internship at NVIDIA was my first real-world engineering experience after working as a SolidWorks TA, where I taught CAD fundamentals and design principles. While teaching gave me a strong foundation, stepping into NVIDIA's fast-paced environment took my skills to a whole new level.

### Navigating Remote Work During COVID-19

One of the most significant aspects of my internship was adapting to a fully remote environment during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. What should have been an in-person experience in NVIDIA's Santa Clara headquarters became a virtual journey that came with unique challenges:

- **Virtual Onboarding and Integration**: Building connections with my team through screens instead of in-person interactions required extra effort and intentionality. I scheduled regular virtual coffee chats with team members to build relationships despite the physical distance.

- **Technical Hurdles**: Setting up complex CAD software remotely presented initial challenges, from VPN connectivity issues to figuring out how to access secure design repositories from home. I quickly learned to troubleshoot technical problems independently.

- **Collaborative Design Remotely**: CAD work typically benefits from over-the-shoulder reviews and hands-on guidance. Instead, I had to adapt to screen-sharing sessions and detailed written feedback, developing clear communication skills to overcome the distance.

- **Work-Life Boundaries**: Managing the blurred lines between professional and personal life while working from my apartment required developing strict routines and dedicated workspace arrangements to maintain focus and productivity.

Despite these challenges, the remote format ultimately strengthened my self-reliance, digital collaboration skills, and ability to communicate technical concepts clearly—valuable skills that would serve me well in my future career.

### Automating CAD Workflows with C++

One of my key projects involved developing C++ scripts to automate repetitive tasks in our CAD software. This significantly boosted efficiency, reducing manual work by about 15% and allowing engineers to focus on higher-value design tasks. It was my first time applying C++ in a real-world setting, and seeing my code streamline processes was both exciting and rewarding.

### Mastering GD&T and Precision Engineering

I also gained hands-on experience with Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&T), ensuring that every design met precise manufacturing standards. This was a major shift from my prior academic projects, where tolerances were often an afterthought. At NVIDIA, precision was everything—every component had to be manufacturable at scale, and I became the go-to person for verifying compliance with GD&T standards.

### Designing with Manufacturability in Mind

Applying Design for Manufacturability (DFM) principles was another major learning experience. I learned to think beyond just creating a perfect CAD model—each design needed to be optimized for cost-effective and scalable production. This aspect of the internship challenged me to balance creativity with real-world constraints, reinforcing the importance of practical engineering design.

### 3D Modeling and Large-Scale Layouts

A big part of my role involved creating detailed 3D models of equipment and data center layouts. Transitioning from modeling individual parts to designing large-scale systems was eye-opening. It required meticulous attention to detail and a strong understanding of spatial organization to ensure everything fit together seamlessly.

### Expanding My CAD Toolkit

During this internship, I worked extensively with multiple CAD tools, including Creo, Windchill, SolidWorks, and Fusion 360. While I was already proficient in SolidWorks from my TA experience, mastering new platforms broadened my skill set and deepened my understanding of industry-standard design workflows.

### Remote Collaboration Skills Development

The pandemic environment forced me to develop robust virtual collaboration skills:

- **Detailed Documentation**: I created comprehensive documentation of my work to ensure clarity across time zones and asynchronous collaboration.

- **Effective Digital Communication**: I learned to articulate complex design concepts clearly through written explanations, annotated screenshots, and recorded walkthroughs when live demonstrations weren't possible.

- **Time Management**: Working across multiple time zones with team members in different locations required careful scheduling and prioritization to ensure project deadlines were met.

### Wrapping Up: A Defining First Internship

Looking back, my time at NVIDIA was an invaluable first step into the engineering world. It bridged the gap between the theoretical knowledge I had as a TA and the practical skills required in a high-tech industry. This experience not only sharpened my technical abilities but also solidified my passion for engineering design, automation, and problem-solving.

The additional layer of navigating a remote internship during unprecedented global circumstances developed my resilience and adaptability—skills that proved just as valuable as the technical knowledge I gained. The ability to thrive in a virtual environment and maintain productivity despite the isolation of the pandemic demonstrated my commitment and self-motivation to potential employers.

It was the perfect start to my journey—one that would later lead me to robotics, AI, and deeper explorations into intelligent systems.
