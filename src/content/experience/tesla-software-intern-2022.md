### Working on System Efficiency

I worked closely with software engineers to develop and test application procedures that improved system efficiency. This meant analyzing existing processes and figuring out ways to make them better and optimize performance.

### Project Tracking System

Tesla's operations involved a ton of complex projects, each with their own scopes, timelines, and budgets. I played a big role in implementing a project tracking system that changed how projects were managed at GigaTexas. This system tracked over 30,000 scopes worth over $300 million from start to finish. By integrating labor tracking, spending reports, funding forecasts, and project controls, we gave stakeholders real-time insights into project progress and potential risks. This let them make proactive decisions and keep projects on track.

### Building Dashboards and Reports

Using my web development and Power BI skills, I built dashboards and reports that gave stakeholders useful insights into project productivity, progress, changes, and KPIs. These dashboards presented data in a visually compelling way and let stakeholders drill down into specific metrics, spot trends, and make informed decisions. From designing user interfaces to implementing complex data pipelines, this project let me show what I could do while delivering real value to the organization.

### Working with the BIM Team

I worked closely with the Building Information Modeling (BIM) team at the Texas Giga Factory and got hands-on experience managing digital models and data representations of the factory and its production assets. From coordinating design and construction efforts to optimizing factory layouts for maximum efficiency, I played an important role in making sure there was smooth collaboration across engineering, construction, manufacturing, and operations teams. This meant using my knowledge of CAD/BIM software and industry best practices to drive continuous improvement in digital modeling processes.

### LiDAR and Reality Capture

As part of Tesla's focus on innovation, I got to work with cutting-edge technologies like LiDAR scanning and reality capture. Using these technologies, we created highly accurate "As-Built" records of the factory and its production components. From conducting LiDAR scans to processing point cloud data and resolving clashes in 3D models, I gained hands-on experience with the latest tools and techniques used in the industry.

### The Tesla Cyber Rodeo Event

One of the coolest parts of my time at Tesla was attending the Cyber Rodeo event at the Giga Texas factory. This grand opening event was basically a huge celebration of innovation, bringing together employees, industry leaders, and Tesla enthusiasts from around the world. It was honestly an electrifying experience. I got a firsthand look at the cutting-edge advancements in electric vehicle technology and sustainable energy solutions. The event featured a showcase of Tesla's latest products, including the much-anticipated Cybertruck, and offered tours of the state-of-the-art Gigafactory. Talking with other engineers and industry experts, I got deeper insights into the future of electric mobility and how advanced manufacturing technologies are driving sustainable growth. The Cyber Rodeo reinforced my commitment to contributing to technological advancements and inspired me to keep pushing what is possible.
