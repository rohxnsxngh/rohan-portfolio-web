### Collaborating for System Efficiency

I collaborated closely with software engineers to develop and test application procedures aimed at enhancing system efficiency. This involved analyzing existing processes and implementing improvements to optimize performance.

### Implementing a Project Tracking System

At the heart of Tesla's operations lay a complex web of projects, each with its own set of scopes, timelines, and budgets. I played a pivotal role in implementing a robust project tracking system that revolutionized how projects were managed at GigaTexas. This system meticulously tracked over 30,000 scopes, worth over $300 million, from inception to completion. By integrating labor tracking, spending reports, funding forecasts, and project controls, we provided stakeholders with real-time insights into project progress and potential risks, enabling proactive decision-making and ensuring projects stayed on track.

### Developing Dashboards and Reports

Using my expertise in web development and Power BI, I took on the challenge of developing dashboards and reports that provided stakeholders with actionable insights into project productivity, progress, changes, and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These dashboards not only presented data in a visually compelling manner but also allowed stakeholders to drill down into specific metrics, identify trends, and make informed decisions. From designing user interfaces to implementing complex data pipelines, this project allowed me to showcase my technical prowess while delivering tangible value to the organization.

### Assisting the BIM Team in Digital Modeling

Working closely with the Building Information Modeling (BIM) team at the Texas Giga Factory, I gained firsthand experience in managing digital models and data representations of the factory and its production assets. From coordinating design and construction efforts to optimizing factory layouts for maximum efficiency, I played a pivotal role in ensuring seamless collaboration across engineering, construction, manufacturing, and operations teams. This involved leveraging my understanding of CAD/BIM software and industry best practices to drive continuous improvement and innovation in digital modeling processes.

### Leveraging Advanced Technologies for Reality Capture

As part of Tesla's commitment to innovation, I had the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies like LiDAR scanning and reality capture. By harnessing the power of these technologies, we were able to create highly accurate "As-Built" records of the factory and its production components. From conducting LiDAR scans to processing point cloud data and resolving clashes in 3D models, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in the latest tools and techniques used in the industry.

### Attending the Tesla Cyber Rodeo Event

One of the highlights of my time at Tesla was attending the Cyber Rodeo event at the Giga Texas factory. This grand opening event was a celebration of innovation, bringing together employees, industry leaders, and Tesla enthusiasts from around the world. It was an electrifying experience, providing a firsthand look at the cutting-edge advancements in electric vehicle technology and sustainable energy solutions. The event featured a showcase of Tesla's latest products, including the much-anticipated Cybertruck, and offered immersive tours of the state-of-the-art Gigafactory. Engaging with fellow engineers and industry experts, I gained deeper insights into the future of electric mobility and the role of advanced manufacturing technologies in driving sustainable growth. The Cyber Rodeo not only reinforced my commitment to contributing to technological advancements but also inspired me to continue pushing the boundaries of innovation in my career.
