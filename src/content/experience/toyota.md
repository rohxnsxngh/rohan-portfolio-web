### Data Analytics and ML

During my rotation with the Data Analytics and Machine Learning team, I developed predictive maintenance algorithms using reinforcement learning to improve system efficiency and reliability. By using data analytics and machine learning, I helped optimize vehicle performance and work toward continuous improvement in Toyota's automotive solutions.

### Software Reliability and Telematics Monitoring

In the software reliability rotation, I focused on setting up monitoring workflows using Datadog and telematics modules. I implemented real-time logging, alerting, and anomaly detection to make sure critical automotive systems were performing as expected. By integrating telemetry data from connected vehicles, I helped improve diagnostic capabilities, reduce downtime, and strengthen predictive maintenance strategies. This work was important for making sure Toyota's software ecosystem was reliable and that we were taking a proactive approach to monitoring and optimization.
