After I finished my internship at Tesla, I got really into graphics development. Whether it was OpenGL/WebGL or using Three.js, I genuinely enjoyed it. There was something about making and refining a vision that just clicked with me. Naturally, this led me to mess around with game development.

Like any developer (pre-ChatGPT), I would run into obscure bugs all the time and spend hours scouring the internet for solutions. During these deep dives, I kept stumbling upon niche blogs and Reddit threads where people shared their troubleshooting experiences. One day, on a whim, I decided to start contributing my own insights. I posted some of my projects and solutions on the same Reddit threads I had been using for answers. I really enjoyed the feedback and critiques from other people who were also passionate about building stuff.

## Landing My First Freelance Client

One thing led to another, and eventually, I got a DM from someone asking if I would be open to helping them build a web-based tool for 3D modeling and simulation. I had never even thought about freelancing before, but the idea was interesting. It felt like a natural extension of the work I was already doing for fun.

Here's the thing though, I had absolutely no idea how to structure this kind of work. Do I charge hourly? Do I need a contract? How do I protect myself legally? I reached out to some experienced freelancers, and they gave me some really helpful advice:

- **Set up an LLC** for liability protection and tax benefits.
- **Use contract templates** to define scope, timelines, and payment terms.
- **Track work hours** and use milestone-based billing for security.

I took their advice, founded **Quaternion Studios**, and officially kicked off my freelancing journey.

## The Six-Month Project That Changed Everything

This first project ended up taking six months. The client wanted a web-based tool that let users manipulate 3D models in real time for construction materials procurement and tracking. I had some experience with WebGL, but this was my first time applying it to an actual client-driven project with real stakes.

### **Phase 1: Understanding Client Needs**

The initial stage was basically just a bunch of meetings to nail down what they actually wanted. The client had an idea but had no clue how to implement it. I quickly realized that freelancing was not just about writing code. It was about understanding what the client actually needs and translating that into technical solutions.

- I created wireframes and mockups to visualize the UI.
- We set clear deliverables and milestones.
- I proposed a **phased approach**, breaking the project into smaller, testable parts.

### **Phase 2: Development & Iteration**

This was the most intense part. I spent my evenings and weekends developing the core functionality while also working my full-time job. It was exhausting but honestly kind of fun. Some things I learned during this phase:

- **Time Management:** I was putting in about 20 hours per week on freelancing. I used Trello to keep track of tasks and Clockify to track my hours.
- **Client Communication:** Weekly Zoom calls were crucial to make sure we were on the same page.
- **Version Control & Deployment:** GitHub for version control and Vercel for quick previews made life so much easier.
- **Problem Solving:** Some unexpected challenges (like optimizing rendering performance) forced me to learn new techniques on the fly, which was stressful but educational.

### **Phase 3: Delivery & Refinement**

As we got closer to the end, the project actually started coming together. I delivered an MVP that the client loved, and we spent another month making it better based on user feedback.

One of the biggest lessons I learned was dealing with **scope creep**. The project had a defined scope at the beginning, but as we went along, new feature requests kept coming in. I had to get good at negotiating which features were part of the original contract and which ones would cost extra. This was awkward at first but necessary.

## Expanding My Freelance Business

After finishing this project, I had something really valuable: a proven track record. My client was super happy and actually referred me to two other companies looking for similar tools. Suddenly, freelancing was not just a side thing anymore. It was real income.

### **How I Scaled Up in the Next 3 Months**

- **Increased my rates**: Once I proved I could deliver, I started charging way more based on the value I was providing.
- **Targeted high-value clients**: I focused on industries like simulation, robotics, and AI-driven applications where the budgets were bigger.
- **Refined my sales strategy**: I got better at writing proposals and reaching out to potential clients.
- **Automated business processes**: I set up Stripe for payments, QuickBooks for accounting, and Docusign for contracts so I was not doing everything manually.

By the end of Q2 2024, I had completed multiple projects and made an additional **$50,000 in revenue**. Here's how it broke down:

- **Machine Learning Projects:** $20,000
- **Web Development (Three.js, WebGL):** $15,000
- **Computer Vision Applications:** $10,000
- **Consulting & Advisory Work:** $5,000

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Business Acumen Matters as Much as Technical Skills**
Freelancing is not just about being good at coding. You need to know how to negotiate, communicate, and understand business needs. Learning how to set expectations, price my work correctly, and handle contracts was just as important as the actual coding.

### **2. Portfolio & Online Presence Are Everything**
Having a solid portfolio and being active on platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, and GitHub made a huge difference in getting noticed. People need to see your work before they trust you with theirs.

### **3. Time Management is the Key to Avoiding Burnout**
Balancing freelancing with a full-time job was honestly rough at times. You need really strict time management. I had dedicated work hours, avoided clients that seemed like they would be a pain, and set clear boundaries. Without that, I definitely would have burned out.

## The Future: Scaling Beyond Solo Freelancing

Now that I’ve built momentum, I’m thinking bigger:

- **Increasing rates further and working with premium clients.**
- **Exploring passive income streams (e.g., digital products, online courses).**
- **Potentially transitioning Quaternion Studios into a small agency model.**
- **Expanding into AI-driven simulation tools and high-end consulting.**

## Advice for Aspiring Freelancers

If you’re considering freelancing, here’s what worked for me:

- **Start by sharing your work online.** You never know who’s watching.
- **Be open to opportunities.** My first project found me, not the other way around.
- **Set up your business correctly.** Get an LLC, use contracts, and protect yourself.
- **Don’t undersell yourself.** Price based on value, not just time.
- **Prioritize relationships.** Good clients lead to more work.

## Conclusion

Freelancing started as an experiment but quickly turned into a real income source and an exciting path forward. The extra money is obviously great, but the real reward has been the skills I picked up, the people I met, and the business knowledge I gained. If you're thinking about freelancing, honestly just start. Put yourself out there, learn as you go, and see what happens. You might surprise yourself.
