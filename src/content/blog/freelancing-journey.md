After I finished my internship at Tesla, I became really interested in graphics development. Whether it was OpenGL/WebGL or using Three.js, I genuinely enjoyed it. There was something about making and refining a vision that fascinated me. Naturally, this led me to experiment with game development.

Like any developer (pre-ChatGPT), I often ran into obscure bugs and would scour the internet looking for solutions. During these deep dives, I frequently stumbled upon niche blogs and Reddit threads where people shared their troubleshooting experiences. One day, on a whim, I decided to start contributing my own insights. I posted some of my projects and solutions on the same Reddit threads I had been using for answers. I enjoyed the feedback and critiques from like-minded individuals who were also passionate about building in this space.

## Landing My First Freelance Client

One thing led to another, and eventually, I received a direct message from someone asking if I’d be open to helping them build a specific web-based tool for 3D modeling and simulation. I had never considered freelancing before, but the idea intrigued me. It felt like a natural extension of the work I was already passionate about.

I had no idea how to structure this kind of work. Do I charge hourly? Do I need a contract? How do I protect myself legally? I reached out to some experienced freelancers, and they gave me invaluable advice:

- **Set up an LLC** for liability protection and tax benefits.
- **Use contract templates** to define scope, timelines, and payment terms.
- **Track work hours** and use milestone-based billing for security.

I took their advice, founded **Quaternion Studios**, and officially kicked off my freelancing journey.

## The Six-Month Project That Changed Everything

This first project ended up spanning six months. The client wanted a web-based tool that allowed users to manipulate 3D models in real time for the purpose of construction materials procurement and tracking. While I had experience in WebGL, this was my first time applying it to a structured, client-driven project.

### **Phase 1: Understanding Client Needs**

The initial stage involved several in-depth meetings to nail down the specifications. The client had an idea but wasn’t sure how to implement it. I quickly realized that freelancing wasn’t just about writing code—it was about understanding and translating client needs into technical solutions.

- I created wireframes and mockups to visualize the UI.
- We set clear deliverables and milestones.
- I proposed a **phased approach**, breaking the project into smaller, testable parts.

### **Phase 2: Development & Iteration**

This was the most intense part. I spent evenings and weekends developing the core functionality while balancing my full-time job. Some key takeaways from this phase:

- **Time Management:** I dedicated 20 hours per week to freelancing, using tools like Trello for task management and Clockify for time tracking.
- **Client Communication:** Weekly check-ins via Zoom ensured we stayed aligned.
- **Version Control & Deployment:** I used GitHub for collaboration and Vercel for quick previews.
- **Problem Solving:** Some unexpected challenges (like optimizing rendering performance) forced me to learn new techniques on the fly.

### **Phase 3: Delivery & Refinement**

As we approached the final stretch, the project started coming together. I delivered an MVP that exceeded the client’s expectations, and we spent another month refining the UX/UI based on user feedback.

One of the biggest lessons I learned was **managing scope creep**. Initially, the project had a defined scope, but as we progressed, new feature requests kept coming in. I had to carefully negotiate which features were part of the original contract and which required additional payment.

## Expanding My Freelance Business

After completing this project, I had something invaluable: **a proven track record**. My client was thrilled and referred me to two other companies looking for similar tools. Suddenly, freelancing wasn’t just a side experiment—it was a viable income stream.

### **How I Scaled Up in the Next 3 Months**

- **Increased my rates**: I started charging premium rates based on the value I delivered.
- **Targeted high-value clients**: Focused on industries like simulation, robotics, and AI-driven applications.
- **Refined my sales strategy**: Improved my proposal writing and client outreach.
- **Automated business processes**: Used Stripe for payments, QuickBooks for accounting, and Docusign for contracts.

By the end of Q2 2024, I had completed multiple projects and made an additional **$50,000 in revenue**, broken down as follows:

- **Machine Learning Projects:** $20,000
- **Web Development (Three.js, WebGL):** $15,000
- **Computer Vision Applications:** $10,000
- **Consulting & Advisory Work:** $5,000

## Lessons Learned

### **1. Business Acumen Matters as Much as Technical Skills**
Freelancing isn’t just about being good at coding—it’s about negotiation, communication, and understanding business needs. Learning how to set expectations, price my work, and handle contracts was crucial.

### **2. Portfolio & Online Presence Are Everything**
A well-structured portfolio and active engagement on platforms like Reddit, LinkedIn, and GitHub played a massive role in getting noticed.

### **3. Time Management is the Key to Avoiding Burnout**
Balancing freelancing with a full-time job is possible but requires strict time management. Having **dedicated work hours**, avoiding low-value clients, and setting clear boundaries helped me maintain work-life balance.

## The Future: Scaling Beyond Solo Freelancing

Now that I’ve built momentum, I’m thinking bigger:

- **Increasing rates further and working with premium clients.**
- **Exploring passive income streams (e.g., digital products, online courses).**
- **Potentially transitioning Quaternion Studios into a small agency model.**
- **Expanding into AI-driven simulation tools and high-end consulting.**

## Advice for Aspiring Freelancers

If you’re considering freelancing, here’s what worked for me:

- **Start by sharing your work online.** You never know who’s watching.
- **Be open to opportunities.** My first project found me, not the other way around.
- **Set up your business correctly.** Get an LLC, use contracts, and protect yourself.
- **Don’t undersell yourself.** Price based on value, not just time.
- **Prioritize relationships.** Good clients lead to more work.

## Conclusion

Freelancing started as an experiment but quickly turned into a major income source and an exciting career path. The additional income is great, but the real reward has been the skills I developed, the people I met, and the business acumen I gained. If you’re thinking about freelancing, there’s never been a better time to start. Put yourself out there, learn as you go, and embrace the process!
