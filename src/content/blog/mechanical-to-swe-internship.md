I started my degree in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University in 2019. If I’m being completely honest, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do. I enjoyed designing and creative applications, and I knew that I was relatively decent at math, so engineering seemed like a logical choice. What I didn’t realize at the time was how much my journey would evolve beyond mechanical engineering and into software.

## The Wake-Up Call

My first semester at Texas A&M was a wake-up call. Everyone told me that college wasn’t like high school and that I needed to learn how to study, but I didn’t fully grasp it until I saw my grades. I ended my first semester with a 2.8 GPA. A C in Chemistry, Chemistry Lab, and Art History was enough to put me in a tough spot. Texas A&M has an “Entry to Major” system, meaning students have to apply to their major after their first semester, and I didn’t make the automatic admission cutoff for Mechanical Engineering. Since it was one of the most competitive majors, I knew I had an uphill battle.

But this setback taught me something valuable—resilience. I doubled down on my efforts, got into Mechanical Engineering, and kept pushing forward.

## The Spark: Robotics and Software

My introduction to software engineering didn’t come from a class—it came from a robotics club. I started messing around with Arduinos, simple simulations, and writing scripts to automate mechanical tasks. That was the first time I saw how software could enhance mechanical engineering, and it fascinated me.

The real turning point came when I caught the attention of a Tesla recruiter for a specialized internship in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Factory Engineering. At that point, I wasn’t a software engineer by any means, but I had enough technical curiosity to dive in. The next few weeks were a blur—I prepped for the interview, learned as much as I could about BIM, software applications in manufacturing, and automation.

After four rounds of interviews, I received my offer in November 2021. I took a co-op position, notified my advisors, and moved to Austin in January 2022.

## Learning from the Best

At Tesla, I met my manager, someone who was entirely self-taught. He never graduated from college—he didn’t even finish high school—but he had an incredible depth of knowledge. More than anything, he embodied a problem-solving mindset, and he expected the same from me.

Over the next nine months, he threw challenge after challenge my way, pushing me into unfamiliar situations. I started automating mechanical workflows, writing scripts for data analysis, and even working with BIM software in ways I had never imagined. He wasn’t just teaching me technical skills; he was teaching me how to learn, how to approach problems from first principles, and how to get comfortable with the unknown.

By the time my co-op ended, I felt like I had barely scratched the surface of software engineering—but I knew I wanted more.

## The Transition: From Mechanical to Software

When I returned to school, I had one goal: break into software engineering. I knew I had to be strategic about it, so I focused on a few key areas.

### 1. **Building My Software Foundation**

- Learned Python (since it’s useful for both mechanical and software applications)
- Mastered fundamental programming concepts, including object-oriented programming
- Built projects that automated mechanical tasks and simulations

### 2. **Developing Real-World Projects**

- Created automation scripts for CAD software
- Developed data analysis tools for manufacturing processes
- Built small applications that blended mechanical and software engineering concepts

### 3. **Creating a Strong Portfolio**

- Maintained an active GitHub profile with well-documented projects
- Built a personal website to showcase my work
- Wrote about my journey, bridging mechanical and software engineering

## Breaking Into Software Internships

I knew that landing a software engineering internship as a mechanical engineer wasn’t going to be easy, so I took a strategic approach.

### 1. **Targeting the Right Companies**

- Focused on industries where mechanical and software overlap: robotics, automation, and IoT
- Applied to companies that valued interdisciplinary skills
- Highlighted my unique background in both software and mechanical systems

### 2. **Tailoring My Resume**

- Emphasized software projects and programming experience
- Showcased my problem-solving abilities from Tesla and robotics projects
- Demonstrated continuous learning and adaptability

### 3. **Mastering the Interview Process**

- Practiced coding challenges daily (LeetCode, NeetCode, and system design)
- Studied data structures and algorithms
- Prepared compelling stories about my transition from mechanical to software engineering

## Networking and Community

Breaking into software engineering wasn’t just about skills—it was about connections.

- **Joined tech communities**: Attended meetups, participated in online forums, and engaged with software engineers
- **Found mentors**: Connected with engineers who had made similar transitions and sought their guidance
- **Leveraged LinkedIn**: Shared my journey and engaged with professionals in the industry

## Conclusion: Why This Path is Worth It

Transitioning from mechanical to software engineering was not easy, but it was one of the most rewarding decisions I’ve made. My background in mechanical engineering gave me a unique perspective and problem-solving approach that set me apart. It wasn’t just about coding—it was about applying engineering thinking to software development.

If you’re a mechanical engineer looking to break into software, know that it’s possible. Be relentless, stay curious, and leverage your unique skills. The intersection of mechanical and software engineering is full of opportunities, and the tech world values diverse problem-solvers.

Your background is not a weakness—it’s an advantage. Use it.
