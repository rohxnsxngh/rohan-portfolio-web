I started my degree in Mechanical Engineering at Texas A&M University in 2019. If I'm being completely honest, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I liked designing stuff and creative applications, and I was pretty decent at math, so engineering seemed like a logical choice. What I did not realize at the time was how much my path would change and lead me into software instead.

## The Wake-Up Call

My first semester at Texas A&M was rough. Everyone told me that college was not like high school and that I needed to actually learn how to study, but I did not fully understand until I saw my grades. I ended my first semester with a 2.8 GPA. Getting a C in Chemistry, Chemistry Lab, and Art History put me in a really tough spot. Texas A&M has this "Entry to Major" system where students have to apply to their major after their first semester, and I did not make the automatic admission cutoff for Mechanical Engineering. Since it was one of the most competitive majors, I knew I had an uphill battle ahead.

This setback honestly sucked, but it taught me something valuable about resilience. I doubled down on my efforts, eventually got into Mechanical Engineering, and kept pushing forward.

## The Spark: Robotics and Software

My introduction to software engineering did not come from a class. It came from a robotics club. I started messing around with Arduinos, simple simulations, and writing scripts to automate mechanical tasks. That was the first time I realized how software could make mechanical engineering way more powerful, and it was honestly really cool.

The real turning point came when I caught the attention of a Tesla recruiter for a specialized internship in Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Factory Engineering. At that point, I was not a software engineer by any means, but I had enough technical curiosity and some projects to show. The next few weeks were intense. I prepped for the interview, learned as much as I could about BIM, software applications in manufacturing, and automation.

After four rounds of interviews, I got an offer in November 2021. I took a co-op position, told my advisors, and moved to Austin in January 2022.

## Learning from the Best

At Tesla, I met my manager, who was entirely self-taught. He never graduated from college. He did not even finish high school. But he had an insane amount of knowledge. More than anything, he had this problem-solving mindset and expected the same from me.

Over the next nine months, he threw challenge after challenge at me, constantly pushing me into unfamiliar territory. I started automating mechanical workflows, writing scripts for data analysis, and working with BIM software in ways I had never imagined. He was not just teaching me technical skills. He was teaching me how to learn, how to approach problems from first principles, and how to get comfortable with not knowing things.

By the time my co-op ended, I felt like I had barely scratched the surface of software engineering. But I knew I wanted more.

## The Transition: From Mechanical to Software

When I got back to school, I had one goal. Break into software engineering. I knew I had to be smart about it, so I focused on a few key areas.

### Building My Software Foundation

I learned Python first since it is useful for both mechanical and software stuff. I worked on mastering fundamental programming concepts like object-oriented programming. And I built projects that automated mechanical tasks and simulations to show I could apply software to real problems.

### Developing Real-World Projects

I created automation scripts for CAD software. I built data analysis tools for manufacturing processes. And I made small applications that blended mechanical and software engineering concepts together. The goal was to show that my mechanical background was actually an advantage, not a liability.

### Creating a Portfolio

I kept an active GitHub profile with well-documented projects. I built a personal website to showcase my work. And I wrote about my journey, trying to explain how mechanical and software engineering connected. This ended up being really important for standing out.

## Breaking Into Software Internships

I knew that landing a software engineering internship as a mechanical engineer was not going to be easy, so I had to be smart about it.

### 1. **Targeting the Right Companies**

- I focused on industries where mechanical and software overlap: robotics, automation, and IoT
- Applied to companies that valued people with skills in multiple areas
- Made sure to highlight my unique background in both software and mechanical systems

### 2. **Tailoring My Resume**

- Emphasized software projects and programming experience over the mechanical stuff
- Showed off my problem-solving abilities from Tesla and robotics projects
- Made it clear that I was constantly learning and adapting

### 3. **Mastering the Interview Process**

- Practiced coding challenges daily on LeetCode and NeetCode. I also studied system design even though I barely understood it at first.
- Grinded data structures and algorithms until they made sense
- Prepared stories about my transition from mechanical to software that actually sounded compelling

## Networking and Community

Breaking into software engineering was not just about skills. It was also about who you knew.

- **Joined tech communities**: I attended meetups, participated in online forums, and tried to engage with actual software engineers
- **Found mentors**: I connected with engineers who had made similar transitions and asked for their advice
- **Leveraged LinkedIn**: I shared my journey and tried to engage with professionals in the industry. Some responded, most did not, but it was worth trying.

## Conclusion: Why This Path is Worth It

Transitioning from mechanical to software engineering was not easy, but it was one of the best decisions I have made. My background in mechanical engineering gave me a different perspective and problem-solving approach that honestly set me apart. It was not just about coding. It was about applying engineering thinking to software.

If you are a mechanical engineer looking to break into software, know that it is definitely possible. Be persistent, stay curious, and use your unique skills to your advantage. The intersection of mechanical and software engineering has a ton of opportunities, and the tech world actually values people who can think differently.

Your background is not a weakness. It is an advantage if you use it right.
